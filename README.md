Data Compression using Arithmetic Coding for CAN Bus in Automobiles
Overview
This repository provides an implementation of data compression using arithmetic coding, tailored for applications in automobiles utilizing the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The goal is to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the CAN bus, optimizing bandwidth usage while maintaining the integrity of critical information.

Arithmetic Coding
Arithmetic coding is a form of entropy encoding that represents a message as a single number within a specified range. It achieves compression by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols. In the context of CAN bus data compression, arithmetic coding can be employed to efficiently encode and decode messages for transmission and reception.

Implementation
The Python implementation in this repository demonstrates the application of arithmetic coding to compress and decompress CAN bus messages. The algorithm is designed to handle the unique characteristics of automotive data, providing an effective solution for reducing data size without compromising information accuracy.
